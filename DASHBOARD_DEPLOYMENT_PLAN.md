# 🚀 Dashboard Deployment Plan

## 📋 Pre-Deployment Checklist ✅

### Backups Created:
- ✅ `backups/lovelace-backup-20250801-222645.yaml` - Your current main dashboard
- ✅ `backups/lovelace-org-backup-20250801-222653.yaml` - Your org dashboard
- ✅ `ui-lovelace.yaml` - New beautiful dashboard ready for deployment

## 🎯 Deployment Options

### Option 1: Safe Testing Approach (RECOMMENDED)
1. **Test the new dashboard first** by accessing it at:
   - `http://your-home-assistant-url:8123/lovelace-ui-lovelace`
   - This uses the `ui-lovelace.yaml` file without affecting your main dashboard

2. **If you love it**, then replace your main dashboard:
   ```bash
   # Backup current (already done)
   cp lovelace.yaml backups/lovelace-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S).yaml
   
   # Deploy new dashboard
   cp ui-lovelace.yaml lovelace.yaml
   ```

### Option 2: Direct Replacement (BOLD)
```bash
# Replace main dashboard directly
cp ui-lovelace.yaml lovelace.yaml
```

### Option 3: Side-by-Side Comparison
Keep both dashboards and switch between them:
- Main dashboard: `http://your-home-assistant-url:8123/lovelace/`
- New dashboard: `http://your-home-assistant-url:8123/lovelace-ui-lovelace`

## 🔧 Required Custom Components

Your new dashboard uses these custom components. Make sure you have them installed:

### Essential Components:
- **custom:button-card** - For the beautiful animated buttons
- **custom:stack-in-card** - For elegant card stacking
- **card-mod** - For custom styling (already in your theme)

### Installation via HACS:
1. Go to HACS → Frontend
2. Search for and install:
   - "Button Card"
   - "Stack In Card"
   - "Card Mod" (if not already installed)

## 🎨 Theme Requirements

✅ Your **Purple Haze** theme is perfect and already configured!

## 🚨 Rollback Plan

If anything goes wrong:

### Quick Rollback:
```bash
# Restore your original dashboard
cp backups/lovelace-backup-20250801-222645.yaml lovelace.yaml
```

### Emergency Access:
- You can always access the default dashboard at: `/lovelace/0`
- Or edit dashboards through the UI: Settings → Dashboards
